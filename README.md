# Welcome to HeartView

A real-time testing system for pacemaker prototypes. 

The pacemaker project is a long standing challenge by Boston Scientific sponsored by McMaster University's Center for Software Certification -> [More](http://sqrl.mcmaster.ca/pacemaker.htm). This repo is the open-source (GPLv3) code base for the HeartView Testing GUI, embedded development files, and design files for the hardware and electrical systems.
